## Important components of our website

### Navbar

We have added a navbar for navigating through different sections of the project.

### About Us page

On clicking the “What we serve” button, our contribution to sustainability comes up in an eye-pleasing animation

### Search bar

On writing your city name, the corresponding AQI data of your city is shown just below the search bar.<br>
Based on that, you can visit the levels tab of our home page, & then click on a particular level based on your AQI

### Levels

Clicking on any of the 6 levels takes you to a separate web page wherein you are shown recommended actions to take at that level.<br>
Clicking on Recommended actions gives way to the “Health impact” info using a clean & satisfying animation.

### Donations using Razorpay

You would be able to make donations that help support our mission of reducing air pollution.<br>
We would use the payments to plant more trees in your name & remove ocean waste using the donated money.<br>
The donations are collected in a seamless manner using the Razorpay API
