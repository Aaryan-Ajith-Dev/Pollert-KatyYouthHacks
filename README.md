## Components of the web page

### Navbar

We have added a navbar for navigating through different sections of the project.

### About Us page

On clicking the “What we serve” button, our contribution to sustainability comes up in a pleasing-to-eye animation

### Search bar

On writing your city name, the corresponding AQI data of your city is shown just below the search bar. 
Based on that, you can visit the levels tab of our home page, & then click on a particular level based on your AQI

### Levels

Clicking on any of the 6 levels takes you to a separate web page wherein you are shown recommended actions to take at that level.
Clicking on Recommended actions gives way for the “Health impact” info using a clean & satisfying animation.
